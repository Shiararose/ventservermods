hey there. if you are NOT part of the 3d&7th fredericton vents group, go away.
hi vents. this is the all the mods you need for the minecraft server and this readme is the windows install guide. 
YOU WILL NEED:
a computer runing windows( if you have a different os ask ciaran for help in the discord)
a copy of minecraft java edition
thats is


to get runing on the server start by downloading this repo as a zip and unzip it

then remove the files README.md and forge-1.16.5-36.2.39-installer.jar from the folder

run forge-1.16.5-36.2.39-installer.jar and use the install client option in the default directory.

when that is done press windows + R, typing in %appdata%, and hitting Enter. Look for the .minecraft folder – once you’ve found it, open the mods directory

then copy all of the remaining files from the unziped folder into the mods directory that you just found

now you can open the minecraft launcher and run the forge instance of minecraft from it then when it opens you go to multiplayer and hit direct conect then type the ip from the discord server and enter the server
